# Soapbug
Small Opensource Applications by Unconventional Gamedevs

Soapbug is a hub for small and tiny games written anywhere from 4 kilobytes to less than 500 bytes. There are two text files, "downloadables.txt" and
"urls.txt". Downloadbles contains the names of all the games available for download and urls contains the games' file urls. If you have a game you want
to add, go right ahead. Soapbug doesn't support game launching *yet*. 

This program was written in BlueJ- which through a series of unfortunate events- I was forced to use because my Raspberry Pi cant handle a real IDE.
